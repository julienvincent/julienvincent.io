So, I sat down to write [a post on using treesitter injections in Neovim](/posts/treesitter-language-injections) but
quickly realised that I needed a way to actually render these code block examples on the wide web.

I suppose I could have just posted screenshots or something, but I don't think that would have really aligned very well
with the spirit of the post.

After a bit of digging I discovered `:ToHtml` (See `:h ToHtml`) in Neovim which allows rendering a section of selected
text as HTML. I could then dump that HTML snippet somewhere and embed it into my page using an `<iframe />` or an
`<object />`.

Eh, it worked. But I couldn't really get it to align just right with the rest of the formatting of the post, and it
looked quite out of place. It was also a real pain to generate the snippets and get them into the right place in my
site. And then you have a bunch of random, disconnected snippets lying around.

What I really wanted was to have some kind of treesitter rendering pipeline going on. My initial idea was to bundle the
`tree-sitter-highlight` crate as a WASM module and render the code-blocks on the fly at runtime. This would also have
the added benefit of allowing readers to change the queries in-place and see how it affects the highlighting.

I tried this out and managed to get just enough of a prototype working that I could see how much effort it would be to
fully realise. I still like the idea but trying to wrangle all the treesitter crates into WASM, plus each grammar I
wanted to use, and build an HTML transformer pipeline on top of it all just seemed a bit exhausting.

Maybe I'll come back to this in the future.

This site is mostly rendered by an MDX compile-time pipeline which uses [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype)
plugins to transform HTML and syntax-highlight markdown code blocks. At the time I was using
[rehype-highlight](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight) which under the hood uses
[highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) for syntax highlighting.

I really like how this pipeline runs entirely at compile-time and just produces a bunch of pre-highlighted, static files
that can be served to the browser. I decided I wanted to retain this property and just swap out the compile-time plugin
with something that was based on treesitter.

## The Task

So here are the overall goals of this project:

- Allow writing posts entirely in MDX, including the code-block examples.
- Perform all code-block syntax highlighting statically and at compile-time
- Allow loading in any treesitter grammars I can find on the wide web (So it needs to be able to compile grammars on the
  fly).
- Produce syntax highlighting results that mimic my editor as closely as possible. This means being able to load and use
  the same Neovim treesitter highlight and injection queries.
- Allow selectively applying treesitter queries to specific code-blocks.

  This was specifically a requirement for the post that I was planning on writing. Being on the topic of treesitter
  injections, it needed a way to show a before-and-after comparison - and therefore a way to selectively apply
  treesitter injection queries.

Now there are some existing rehype treesitter plugins lying around, such as
[this one](https://github.com/haze/rehype-tree-sitter), but none of them met the goals I had outlined for this. I'm also
pretty sure my requirements are going to evolve along with this site and so the only option was to fry up something new.

### The Pipeline

Treesitter has an official
[tree-sitter-highlight](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/da5926d6f571475625bd631c593b255c437e9135/crates/highlight)
crate which exposes a high-level API for working with highlights and injections. This seemed like a good place to start.

The [tree-sitter-loader](https://docs.rs/tree-sitter-loader/0.25.10/tree_sitter_loader/) crate gives us some APIs for
loading and compiling (with cache) treesitter grammars from the filesystem. This means all I need to do is clone down
the grammars I want into some directory and I can dynamically load them up from there.

We also need a way to interact with all of this from JavaScript land, and for this we can build some bindings using
[napi-rs](https://napi.rs/). (What a great experience this was, by the way).

Lastly we can wrap it all up inside a JavaScript rehype plugin interface which spits out
[hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) (HTML AST) `<span>` nodes containing classnames that match our treesitter
highlight captures.

Didn't take too long to get a prototype going, and didn't take much longer after that to realise we had a big problem.
It was all going great until I tried to test out the language injections.

I wanted to apply the following Clojure injection query

```query showLineNumbers={4}
((str_lit) @injection.content
  (#match? @injection.content
    "^\"(CREATE|SELECT)")
  (#offset! @injection.content 0 1 0 -1)
  (#set! injection.language "sql"))
```

Unfortunately the `#offset!`
[directive](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/queries/3-predicates-and-directives.html#directives)
is not baked into treesitter. It's a custom Neovim-specific directive and it's absolutely _required_ for language
injections to work with the Clojure grammar. It allows tweaking the part of the matched node that should be considered
for injections.

At this point I should have just ditched `tree-sitter-highlight` and built it myself, but instead I wasted a few more
hours adding support for `#offset!` to the official crate. This got me _so_ close. It worked! Mostly!

### Neovim Queries

In order to meet my requirement of getting highlighting to match my personal editor (Neovim) I needed to load in the
same queries that are used by my editor.

To do this I cloned down the [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) repo which has a
`./queries` directory containing all the treesitter highlight and injection queries for most languages used by Neovim.
Theoretically, if I loaded up these queries then the resulting highlights should be _identical_. They weren't.

The problem came down to two things:

1. There are a few other Neovim-specific treesitter directives (See `:h treesitter-directives`) besides the `#offset!`
   directive already discussed that are used by these queries, and `tree-sitter-highlight` doesn't support them.
2. Neovim uses its own internal highlighting logic which just doesn't match what `tree-sitter-highlight` spits out. This
   means different highlights end up taking priority, and we have no levers to pull to change this.

The easiest way I could see to solve both of these issues was to actually ditch `tree-sitter-highlight` and just use the
underlying treesitter Query API to process the highlights myself. This would give me the control to handle custom Neovim
directives however I want, and to intentionally make sure the highlight priority matches that produced by Neovim.

### Selective Queries

The highlight pipeline is now chugging along very nicely. All that remains is to add support for selectively applying
queries to code blocks.

We can achieve this by parsing out metadata attached to the code block in our rehype plugin, and use this to select
additional queries to load up and append to the highlighter pipeline.

Here is an example so you can see that in action. The below example has no fancy injections

````markdown nolinenumbers="true"
```clojure
(defn some-func
  "This should now be **markdown**!"
  [])
```
````

But if we attach the `query="docstrings"` property to the code block, this instructs the plugin to load more queries
from the `./queries/docstrings` directory. And now we got some sweet, sweet markdown highlighting.

````markdown query="docstrings" nolinenumbers="true"
```clojure query="docstrings"
(defn some-func
  "This should now be **markdown**!"
  [])
```
````

This allows me to, in the same post, show code block examples that both have and don't have special queries!

## The End

Well that pretty much wraps that up. I'm very happy with the result of this little side-quest.

If you find yourself wanting to use any of this for yourself, or just want to reference it for your own use, you can
find the source for the plugin over here:

[julienvincent/rehype-tree-sitter-highlight](https://github.com/julienvincent/rehype-tree-sitter-highlight)

It's not very nicely wrapped up, but knock yourself out.
