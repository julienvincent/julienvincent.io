I do a lot of soldering and up until this point I had just been happily consuming all the toxic smoke produced as a
result. I do have a large sliding door next to my workstation which can provide good ventilation, but it's not good
enough.

I did a bit of research and found that a very common solution is to slap an
[activated carbon filter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004OCSCO6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) in front of a PC fan
and call it a day. Looking at some existing projects and YouTube videos showed this to be seemingly more effective than
it sounds.

I wanted to make this thing myself, but I did look at some reference versions I found on Printables. There are
[a _lot_ of them](https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=fume+extractor) but here are some of the ones I liked best

1. [https://www.printables.com/model/84614-heavy-duty-battery-powered-solder-fume-extractor](https://www.printables.com/model/84614-heavy-duty-battery-powered-solder-fume-extractor)
2. [https://www.printables.com/model/643501-soldering-fume-extractor](https://www.printables.com/model/643501-soldering-fume-extractor)
3. [https://www.printables.com/model/811245-adjustable-solder-fume-extractor](https://www.printables.com/model/811245-adjustable-solder-fume-extractor)

I liked the tilted stand from the first one, but the overall design felt far too blocky for my liking. The second one
there has a much 'thinner' feel to it, especially the frame around the fan.

Most of them seemed to involve some kind of speed control, which to me seems a bit pointless. I'm pretty sure I would
always want to run this at maximum speed all the time. We can swap out the rotary knob with a simple toggle switch
instead.

For the fan selection the [Noctua NF-A14 iPPC-3000](https://www.noctua.at/en/products/nf-a14-industrialppc-3000-pwm)
seems to be a resounding winner in the space. Low noise, high power and good quality. I went with the 140mm version, but
there is also a [120mm version](https://www.noctua.at/en/products/nf-f12-industrialppc-3000-pwm) for a smaller profile.

Most of the existing designs I could find all went with a single carbon filter on the front. Personally I'd rather slap
on one on either side of the fan to maximise my chance of absorbing all the fumes. This would come at the cost of a
little suction power but I am running with a pretty powerful fan, so it should be fine.

As I linked above, I went with two of these
[Hakko A1001 filters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004OCSCO6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) which are actually
replacements for Hakko's own fume extractor. That's a good sign I suppose.

I fired up OnShape and mocked up something I liked, printed it out, and after a few tolerance tweaks I have a
functioning fume extractor!

It honestly works _way_ better than I was expecting. I don't have an air quality sensor on hand so I can't really give
any scientific measurements, but there are no visible fumes leaving the back and I can't really smell any change before
and after using my iron.

If you want to make this yourself you can find my design here:

### Power Source

I do want to power this thing from batteries at some point, but I didn't have anything appropriate on hand so decided to
go with a cabled design for now. I had some 12v power adapters lying around as well as a few DC barrel jacks, so I don't
need to purchase anything special here.

This approach works just fine - but having used this for several months I can say the cable is _absolutely annoying_.
When you're soldering stuff you're often working at weird and awkward angles. The cable somehow gets caught on
everything, including the soldering irons power line.

In the meantime I have ordered some [NCR18650B](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32324914059.html) LiPo cells and will
revisit this when I get some motivation.

I really like how thin the base is and I want to avoid making it thicker just to squeeze in the battery cells plus the
electronics to charge and consume them. I'm guessing I will need to design a custom PCB for this project in order to
keep everything sufficiently compact.
