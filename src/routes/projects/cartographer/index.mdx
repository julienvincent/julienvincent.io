For quite a long time Minecraft was a favourite past-time for myself and a few of my friends. We had a self-hosted
survival world where we would spend hours on end hanging out and building stuff.

We used to play what's called 'technical Minecraft' in the community which is a form of playing where you design and
build electro-mechanical structures / systems to automate various aspects of the game and progress you along the 'tech
tree'.

At one point we wanted to create some [map art](https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Map_Art_of_MCO) which is a mechanism of
placing blocks in a large region to show a picture when viewed on one or more in-game maps.

Today there are quite a few tools out there to do this - but at the time there was basically only
[this one](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/). It was clunky to use, and it didn't support outputting
[Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica/gallery) schematic files which would make building it in Survival
significantly simpler.

So I set out to build a tool which I fondly called Cartographer to streamline the generation of these Litematica schema
files from images.

It has various controls which can be used to alter the final generated structure of the map, and you can try it out
