This is a long running collection of projects all focused around the automation of indoor plant care. I've been working
on it on-and-off for a few years, mostly producing short-lived prototypes.

This overarching project gave me a tangible goal and formed a foundation on top of which I could experiment with and
learn about electronics. This quickly led to my introduction into custom-designed PCB's, and from there my interest in
electrical engineering really took off.

It started out as an idea to design self-contained plant-watering modules which can sense the moisture content of plants
and water them using a pump from a reservoir. Due to many fundamental issues with this approach I instead broke the
project up into smaller, individually complete-able projects.

I plan to write about or document the more interesting projects that spun off from this.
