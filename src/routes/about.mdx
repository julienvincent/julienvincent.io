# About

Hello, I'm Julien. A Software Engineer (by trade), hardware hacker, climber, Neovim enthusiast and Open-Source
contributor. Also, I really like Gruvbox.

Here you can find a collection of writings about tech, publishings on projects I'm working on, or really anything that
I've found interesting enough to write about.

The software that powers this page is [built by me](https://github.com/julienvincent/julienvincent.io) and is currently
hosted on my Home-Lab cluster rack sitting in my living room. Be gentle.
